Managing Permission Sets for complex environments can be cumbersome. Another approach that is supported by Okta is Attribute based access control. As you can see in the following screenshot are Tags and Labels used. Configuration of this use case is out of scope for this workshop. [Good AWS Blog-Post on how to configure this with Okta](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/build-an-end-to-end-attribute-based-access-control-strategy-with-aws-sso-and-okta/). For more details, please also watch [the following video starting at 11:35](https://www.okta.com/resources-webinar-okta-and-aws-making-it-easier-to-use-workforce-identity-on-aws/).
