Managing Permission Sets for complex environments can be cumbersome. Another approach that is supported by Okta is using Okta Workflows to automate AWS IAM Identity Center entitlements. Configuration of this use case is out of scope for this workshop. For more details, please also watch [the following video starting at 14:30](https://www.okta.com/resources-webinar-okta-and-aws-making-it-easier-to-use-workforce-identity-on-aws/).

If you have the **Okta Workflow Engine**, please search for the **Manage AWS IAM Identity Center Entitlements** Template for an example implementation. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/okta/workflows-templates/tree/master/workflows/manage_aws_sso_entitlements).
