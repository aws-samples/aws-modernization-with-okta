Last Updated August 2nd 2022.

In this Workshop you will learn how to integrate Okta with AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS SSO).

Okta provides Single Sign-On with adaptive MFA and advanced user life-cycle management for AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS SSO).

The goal of the workshop is to build an end-to-end demo environment from creating free Okta and AWS accounts, configuring the integration, creating some test groups and testing it at the end. The last chapter covers some more advanced use cases.

## Okta and AWS Marketplace
Okta is available on the AWS Marketplace. AWS Marketplace is a digital software catalog that makes it easy to find, try, buy, deploy, and manage software that runs on AWS. AWS Marketplace has a broad and deep selection of ISV solutions that can help you to get your ideal Identity solution in the cloud.
