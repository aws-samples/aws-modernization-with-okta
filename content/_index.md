In this Workshop you will learn how to integrate Okta with AWS SSO .

Okta provides Single Sign-On with adaptive MFA and advanced user life-cycle management for AWS SSO.

The goal of the workshop is to build an end-to-end demo environment from creating free Okta and AWS accounts, configuring the integration, creating some test groups and testing it at the end. The last chapter covers some more advanced use cases.
