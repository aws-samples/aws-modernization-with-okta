Okta is the trusted platform to secure every identity.

It's an enterprise-grade, identity management service, built in the cloud for the cloud, but also compatible with many on-premises applications. With Okta, IT can manage any employee's access to any application or device. Okta runs in the cloud, on a secure, reliable, extensively audited platform, which integrates deeply with cloud, on-premises applications, directories, and identity management systems.

The Okta solution was born of the unique challenges of how technology has grown and shifted in the growing diversity of devices, identity issues, security, employee mobility, vender partnership, and the exponential growth of unique application options.

Okta features include Provisioning, Single Sign-On (SSO), Active Directory (AD) and LDAP integration, the centralized deprovisioning of users, multifactor authentication (MFA) and flexible policies for organization security and control.



All of these functions are brought together through a network of pre-integrated applications called the {{% button href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/" %}}Okta Integration Network (OIN){{% /button %}}. The OIN provides diverse integration options, enabling SSO login for every app your users need to access during their work day.

In order to enable customers and partners to address every identity use case, we've built a set of modular components, called Platform Services, which can be combined to build new features and tailored experiences faster. These Platform Services are available in Okta's packaged products, APIs, and SDKs.

Benefits of Okta Platform Services
- Build faster: Build new features to cover more use cases faster by combining pre-made components.
- Customize more easily: Tailor Okta to your business using no-code, low-code, or pro-code options.
- Extend across your tech stack: Easily connect to third-party apps and systems to enhance security and user experience.

IT infrastructure failures are inevitable, but cloud services like identity and access management are critical to your business and your customers. Okta is designed for extreme redundancy with unique innovations at each layer of the tech stack to ensure a highly resilient, always on service.

Okta's innovative cells are self-contained instances of the entire Okta service with hundreds of automated, modularized components. Each tier of components has hardware redundancies spread across multiple AWS availability zones that are geographically and logically separated from each other. In addition, each cell has a full backup and duplicate hardware setup in a geographically separate AWS data center for disaster recovery.

The Okta Platform is build on three pillars to protect your identities and data:
