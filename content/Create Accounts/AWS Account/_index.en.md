# Prepare Your Lab Account

For this Workshop you will need Administrator Access to an AWS Account that is not part of an AWS Organization and that is not yet configured for AWS IAM Identity Center.

- If you donâ€™t already have an AWS account with Administrator access: create one now

- Once you have an AWS account, ensure you create an IAM user with the AdministratorAccess managed policy attached to it. You will use this account for the workshop. As a best practice, NEVER use the AWS root account when you are able to use an IAM user instead!
