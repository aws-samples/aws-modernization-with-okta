# Prepare Your Lab Account

If you are at an AWS hosted event (such as re:Invent, Immersion Day, on-site Workshop or other event hosted by AWS employees), you will be provided with a temporary AWS account for the workshop.

If you are running this workshop by yourself, your account must have the ability to create new IAM roles and scope other IAM permissions.

- If you donâ€™t already have an AWS account with Administrator access: create one now

- Once you have an AWS account, ensure you create an IAM user with the AdministratorAccess managed policy attached to it. You will use this account for the workshop. As a best practice NEVER use the AWS root account when you are able to use an IAM user instead!
